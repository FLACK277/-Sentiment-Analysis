## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### NLTK Data Download Issues
```python
import nltk
import ssl

# Fix SSL certificate issues
try:
    _create_unverified_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
except AttributeError:
    pass
else:
    ssl._create_default_https_context = _create_unverified_https_context

# Download required NLTK data
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

#### Memory Issues with Large Datasets
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Use sparse matrices and limit features
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(
    max_features=10000,  # Limit vocabulary size
    min_df=2,           # Ignore rare words
    max_df=0.95,        # Ignore very common words
    ngram_range=(1, 2)  # Use unigrams and bigrams
)

# Process data in chunks for large datasets
chunk_size = 1000
for chunk in pd.read_csv('large_dataset.csv', chunksize=chunk_size):
    processed_chunk = preprocess_chunk(chunk)
```

#### Text Preprocessing Performance
```python
import multiprocessing as mp
from functools import partial

def parallel_text_processing(texts, num_processes=4):
    """Process text data in parallel for better performance"""
    with mp.Pool(processes=num_processes) as pool:
        processed_texts = pool.map(preprocess_text, texts)
    return processed_texts

# Use vectorized operations where possible
import numpy as np
texts = np.array(texts)  # Convert to numpy for faster operations
```

#### Model Training Issues
- **Convergence Warnings**: Increase max_iter parameter or try different solvers
- **Memory Errors**: Reduce max_features in TF-IDF or use feature selection
- **Poor Performance**: Try different preprocessing steps or feature engineering
- **Overfitting**: Use regularization parameters or cross-validation
